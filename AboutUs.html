        About Us
    </h2>
    <div class="about-us">
        Our team of four students from KIIT University's 3rd year CSE undergraduate program has collaborated to create a
        data analytics project under the guidance of Prof. Hrudaya Kumar Tripathy. Our team consists of
        <ul>
            <li>Mohit Kumar Nanda(2005880)</li>
            <li>Nitya Bhanu Gogawat(2005884)</li>
            <li>Soumyo Chakravorty(20051110)</li>
            <li>Pratik Jha(20051572)</li>
        </ul>

        Our project analyzes songs based on various parameters such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode,
        speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, and tempo. By comparing the features of popular
        and less popular songs, we aim to provide data-driven insights to musicians and music industry professionals to
        help them understand what makes a song popular and how to improve less popular songs.

        Our project is significant because the music industry is highly competitive, and musicians and industry
        professionals often struggle to understand what makes a song successful. Our data analytics project offers
        insights that can help professionals in the industry make informed decisions and improve their chances of
        success.

        Looking to the future, we hope to expand the scope of our project by incorporating more advanced data analytics
        techniques and exploring additional factors that influence the popularity of a song. Our team is committed to
        ongoing research and development in the field of music analytics to help musicians and industry professionals
        achieve greater success in the industry.
