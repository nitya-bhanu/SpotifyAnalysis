        In this project, we analyzed a dataset of songs obtained from Kaggle, based on various parameters such as
        danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, and
        tempo. Our goal was to gain insights into what makes a song popular and how to improve less popular songs.

        We began by performing data cleaning and pre-processing to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data. This
        included removing duplicates, filling missing values, and converting data types where necessary.

        Next, we conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of the various parameters
        among the songs in our dataset. We plotted bar charts, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the data and
        identify any trends or patterns.

        We then analyzed the correlation between the parameters and the popularity of the songs, and found that
        danceability, energy, loudness, and tempo had the greatest impact on a song's popularity. We also compared the
        average values of these parameters between popular and less popular songs and found that there were significant
        differences between the two groups.

        Based on these insights, we provided recommendations for improving less popular songs. For example, we found
        that less popular songs had lower values for liveness and speechiness, so increasing these parameters could help
        improve their popularity. Similarly, less popular songs had higher values for acousticness and instrumentalness,
        indicating a need for more emphasis on vocals and lyrics.

        Overall, this project provided valuable insights into what makes a song popular and how to improve less popular
        songs, using data-driven analysis.
