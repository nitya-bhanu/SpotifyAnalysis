        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p class="card-5">
            Many musicians and music industry professionals struggle to understand what makes a song
            popular and how to improve less popular songs. This can lead to a lack of success in the industry, as well
            as
            frustration and confusion about how to create music that resonates with audiences.

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p class="card-5">
            The Spotify Data Analytics project aims to use data analytics to provide insights into what makes a song
            popular
            and how to improve less popular songs. By analyzing songs based on various parameters, the project provides
            a
            data-driven approach to understanding what listeners respond to and how to create music that is more likely
            to
            be successful.

        <h2>Addressing the problem</h2>
        <p class="card-5">
            To address the problem, the Spotify Data Analytics project begins by analyzing songs based on parameters
            such as
            danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence,
            and
            tempo. These parameters are chosen because they are known to be important factors in determining the
            popularity
            of a song.
            <br>
            The project then compares popular and less popular songs based on these parameters to identify areas where
            less
            popular songs can be improved. For example, if less popular songs tend to have lower energy or lower
            danceability than popular songs, the project may recommend increasing these values to make the songs more
            appealing to listeners.
            <br>
            By providing data-driven insights into what makes a song popular and how to improve less popular songs, the
            Spotify Data Analytics project helps musicians and music industry professionals better understand what
            audiences
            respond to and how to create music that is more likely to succeed. The project provides a valuable tool for
            anyone looking to improve their chances of success in the music industry.
